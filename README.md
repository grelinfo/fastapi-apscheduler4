The key feature are:

* **Easy**: Just add a decorator to your function and it will be scheduled.
* **No boilerplate**: Few lines of code to make it work.
* **Out-of-the-box**: Configuration can be done directly from environment variables (Twelve-Factor App standard).

## WORK IN PROGRESS

The project is still in development and not ready for production. The API may change in the future.
Specifically, because APScheduler main dependancy is not yet released and ready for production too.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
